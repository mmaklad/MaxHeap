# MaxHeap
This Java Class implements a Max Binary Heap and uses the heapsort algorithm to sort arrays of integers.

This class was created as a lab for my Data Structures and Algorithms Course. This class uses the heapsort algorithim to order an array of integers in a way such that it becomes a Max Binary Heap.
